Server-side validation in ASP.NET Core MVC is a process where the data submitted by the user is 
validated on the server before it is processed. This ensures that the data meets the required criteria 
and helps prevent invalid data from being processed or stored. 

Server-side validation is crucial for maintaining data integrity, security, and preventing malicious 
inputs.

How Server-Side Validation Works in ASP.NET Core MVC

Model Binding: When a form is submitted, the data is bound to a model.

Validation: The framework automatically validates the model based on the data annotations and custom 
			validation attributes applied to it.

Action Method: If the model is valid, the action method processes the data. If not, the validation 
			   errors are returned to the view.
