In ASP.NET Core MVC, _ViewStart.cshtml is a special file used to define code that you want to run 
before every view in your application. It is commonly used to set up layout pages, but it can also 
include any other code that should be executed before the rendering of every view.

Key Features of _ViewStart.cshtml

Location: The _ViewStart.cshtml file is typically located in the Views folder of your application.

Execution Order: The code in _ViewStart.cshtml runs before the code in each individual view. If you have 
				 multiple _ViewStart.cshtml files in nested folders, the closest one to the view being 
				 rendered will be executed last.

Setting Layout: A common use of _ViewStart.cshtml is to set the layout for the views, so you don’t have 
				to specify the layout in each view individually.


Hierarchical Execution

If you have multiple _ViewStart.cshtml files in your application, they will execute in a hierarchical 
manner, starting from the root down to the specific view’s directory.

For example, if your project structure is as follows:

Views
|-- _ViewStart.cshtml
|-- Home
	|-- _ViewStart.cshtml
	|-- Index.cshtml


When rendering Index.cshtml, the _ViewStart.cshtml files in both the Views folder and the Views/Home 
folder will be executed. 

The one in the Views/Home folder will execute last, allowing it to override settings from the one in 
the Views folder.
