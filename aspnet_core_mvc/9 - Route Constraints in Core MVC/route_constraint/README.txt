In ASP.NET Core MVC, route constraints are used to restrict the values that a route parameter can take. 
They help in ensuring that only specific patterns of URLs are matched. 

There are several methods to add constraints to routes, both in convention-based routing and 
attribute-based routing. Here are the primary methods:

1. Inline Constraints

	- Inline Constraints are specified directly in the route template. This method is simple and concise.

2. Attrobute-Based Constraints

	- Constraints can be added using attributes in attribute-based routing.

3. Custom Route Constraints

	- You can create custom route constraints by implementing the `IRouteConstraint` interface. This is
	  useful for more complex validation logic that cannot be expressed using the built-in constraints.

4. Using Route Constraints in Middleware

	- You can define and use route constraints directly within middleware when setting up your routing.

5. Regular Expression Constraints

	- Regular expression constraints allow you to match specific patterns in route parameters.



Summary

Inline Constraints: Simple constraints added directly to the route template.

Attribute-Based Constraints: Constraints added using attributes in controllers.

Custom Route Constraints: Custom logic for constraints by implementing IRouteConstraint.

Middleware-Based Constraints: Using constraints directly in the routing middleware setup.

Regular Expression Constraints: Matching specific patterns using regular expressions.
