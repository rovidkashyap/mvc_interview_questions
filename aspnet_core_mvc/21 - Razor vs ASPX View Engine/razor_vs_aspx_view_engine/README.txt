Razor and ASPX are two different view engines used in ASP.NET to render HTML from server-side code. 

Here’s a comparison of the two:

Razor View Engine

1. Introduction:

	- Razor is a newer view engine introduced with ASP.NET MVC 3 and is used in ASP.NET Core MVC.
	- It is designed to be lightweight and to provide an optimized syntax for HTML generation.

	- Syntax:

		- Razor uses @ to transition between HTML and C# code.
		- It has a more concise and expressive syntax compared to ASPX.

2. Features:

	- Tighter integration with C#.
	- IntelliSense support in Visual Studio.
	- Simplified syntax for loops and conditional statements.
	- Better performance due to optimized parsing and rendering.
	- Supports layout and partial views.

3. Usage:

	- Widely used in ASP.NET Core MVC and modern ASP.NET MVC applications.

ASPX View Engine

1. Introduction:

	- ASPX, also known as the Web Forms view engine, was used in classic ASP.NET and early versions of 
	  ASP.NET MVC.
	- It uses the Web Forms (.aspx) syntax.

	- Syntax:

		- ASPX uses <%= %> or <%: %> to embed code.
		- It is based on the traditional ASP.NET Web Forms syntax.

2. Features:

	- Uses Web Forms controls and events.
	- Rich server-side controls with extensive event handling.
	- Less concise and more verbose syntax compared to Razor.
	- Historically used with Web Forms applications.

3. Usage:

	- Mostly used in legacy ASP.NET Web Forms and older ASP.NET MVC applications.

Key Differences

1. Syntax:

	- Razor: Uses @ for inline code and has a cleaner, more concise syntax.
	- ASPX: Uses <%= %> and <%: %> for inline code and is more verbose.

2. Integration with C#:

	- Razor: Designed specifically for C#, with better integration and support for IntelliSense.
	- ASPX: Supports C#, but the syntax is more cumbersome.

3. Performance:

	- Razor: Typically faster due to optimized parsing and rendering.
	- ASPX: Generally slower due to the overhead of Web Forms controls and event handling.

4. View Syntax:

	- Razor: Focuses on HTML generation with minimalistic syntax.
	- ASPX: Uses Web Forms control and event-based programming model.

5. Usage and Popularity:

	- Razor: Preferred in modern ASP.NET Core MVC and newer ASP.NET MVC applications.
	- ASPX: Used in legacy Web Forms applications and older ASP.NET MVC projects.

Conclusion

	- Razor is the preferred choice for modern ASP.NET development due to its clean syntax, better 
	  performance, and seamless integration with C#.

	- ASPX is largely used in older or legacy applications that rely on the Web Forms model.


By choosing Razor for new projects, you benefit from a more efficient and developer-friendly view 
engine, while ASPX remains an option for maintaining and updating existing legacy applications.
