Tag Helpers are a feature in ASP.NET Core MVC that allow you to add server-side logic to HTML elements 
in a way that is more natural and HTML-friendly than traditional HTML helpers. 

They are designed to make your views more readable and maintainable by enabling a more HTML-centric 
approach to writing markup.
