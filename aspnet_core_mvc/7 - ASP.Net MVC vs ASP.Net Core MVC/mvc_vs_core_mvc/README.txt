ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core MVC are both web application frameworks developed by Microsoft, but they 
have significant differences in terms of architecture, features, and capabilities. Here are the key 
differences between ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core MVC:

1. Platform and Performance

	- ASP.NET MVC: Built on the .NET Framework, which is Windows-only. It has been around since 2009 and 
				   runs on IIS.

	- ASP.NET Core MVC: Built on the cross-platform .NET Core, which can run on Windows, Linux, and 
				   macOS. It offers significant performance improvements and is designed to be more 
				   lightweight and modular.

2. Modular Framework

	- ASP.NET MVC: Monolithic framework where all components are tightly integrated. The entire 
				   framework must be installed as a whole.

	- ASP.NET Core MVC: Modular framework that allows you to include only the packages and middleware 
				   components you need, reducing the application footprint and improving performance.

3. Hosting

	- ASP.NET MVC: Primarily hosted on IIS (Internet Information Services) for Windows.

	- ASP.NET Core MVC: Can be hosted on various platforms including IIS, Kestrel, HTTP.sys, and can be 
						run in containers like Docker.

4. Dependency Injection

	- ASP.NET MVC: Supports dependency injection, but it is not built-in. Third-party libraries like 
				   Ninject, Autofac, or Unity are commonly used.

	- ASP.NET Core MVC: Built-in dependency injection framework, making it easier to configure services 
						and manage dependencies.

5. Configuration

	- ASP.NET MVC: Configuration is primarily done using XML-based files like web.config.

	- ASP.NET Core MVC: Configuration is done using JSON-based files like appsettings.json, and it 
						supports environment-based configuration, which is more flexible and easier to 
						use.

6. Middleware Pipeline

	- ASP.NET MVC: Does not have a middleware pipeline. It uses HTTP modules and handlers for request 
				   processing.

	- ASP.NET Core MVC: Uses a middleware pipeline, which allows for more granular control over request 
						processing and better performance.

7. Dependency Management

	- ASP.NET MVC: Uses the traditional .NET Framework assembly system and NuGet for package management.

	- ASP.NET Core MVC: Uses the .NET Core assembly system and NuGet for package management, with a 
						focus on lightweight and modular dependencies.

8. Razor View Engine

	- ASP.NET MVC: Uses the Razor view engine, which is integrated into the framework.

	- ASP.NET Core MVC: Uses an updated version of the Razor view engine, with improvements and new 
						features such as tag helpers and view components.

9. Cross-Platform

	- ASP.NET MVC: Runs only on Windows.

	- ASP.NET Core MVC: Cross-platform, running on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

10. Development and Deployment

	- ASP.NET MVC: Typically deployed on Windows Server with IIS. Development is often done using 
					Visual Studio on Windows.

	- ASP.NET Core MVC: Can be developed using Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any other text 
						editor on Windows, Linux, or macOS. Deployment options include IIS, Kestrel, 
						Nginx, Apache, and Docker.

11. Tag Helpers

	- ASP.NET MVC: Does not support tag helpers.

	- ASP.NET Core MVC: Introduces tag helpers, which are server-side components that help to create 
						and render HTML elements in Razor views.

12. Web API Integration

	- ASP.NET MVC: ASP.NET Web API and ASP.NET MVC are separate frameworks.

	- ASP.NET Core MVC: Unified framework for both MVC and Web API, simplifying the development of web 
						applications and APIs.

13. Security Features

	- ASP.NET MVC: Traditional security features based on the .NET Framework.

	- ASP.NET Core MVC: Enhanced security features including improved authentication, authorization, 
						and data protection APIs.

14. Community and Support

	- ASP.NET MVC: Established framework with a large community but is now in maintenance mode with no 
					major updates planned.

	- ASP.NET Core MVC: Actively developed with a growing community, regular updates, and new features 
						being added continuously.
