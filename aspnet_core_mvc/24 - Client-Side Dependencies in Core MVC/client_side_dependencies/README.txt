Managing client-side dependencies in an ASP.NET Core application involves handling JavaScript libraries, 
CSS frameworks, and other client-side resources that your application requires.

Here's how you can manage these dependencies effectively:

1. Using Package Managers
	
	- use npm (Node Package Manager) - `npm install library-name`

	- use Yarn Package Manager - `yarn add library-name`

2. Using LibMan (Library Manager)

	- Visual Studio manages client-side libraries (e.g., jQuery, Bootstrap) without requiring Node.js.

3. CDN (Content Delivery Network)

	- Utilize CDNs for widely-used libraries (e.g., Bootstrap, jQuery)

	- Include CDN links directly in your layout or specific views.

4. Bundler and Minifier

	- Combines and minifies multiple CSS and JavaScript files for production deployment, reducing load 
	  times.
