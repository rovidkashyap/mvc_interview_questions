There are tow main types of HTML Helpers:

1. Standard HTML Helpers
2. Strongly-Types HTML Helpers

1. Standard HTML Helpers :

	- These helpers generate basic HTML markup and are not tied to a specific model property. They are 
	  useful for creating simple HTML elements.

	- For Example, See the Index.cshtml file

2. Strongly-Typed HTML Helpers

	- These helpers are tied to a specific model property and provide better compile-time checking and 
	  IntelliSense support in Visual Studio. They are useful for creating form elements that are bound 
	  to model properties.

	  - For Example, See the Controller and View
